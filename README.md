# TOC Data
This is a collection of table of content (TOC) data for scanned / electronic books that do not have a table of content.

These files are meant to be used in conjunction with tools which add TOC to an existing pdf file. (There is one by me but it is not ready for release yet.)

Naturally, there will be some variation between different scanned copies of the same book, for example, with or without the cover page.
So please download the file and modify the global counter offset according to your need.
